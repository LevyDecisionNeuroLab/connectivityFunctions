# connectivityFunctions
This repository will contain all connectivity functions that were created in Levy Lab at Yale.
The functions reside in the **connUtils.py** file - with comments on each.
The **agingAnalysis.py** file show an example of creating simple timeline + correlation matrix (and plot it) using one subject from the aging project.
